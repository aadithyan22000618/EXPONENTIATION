# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```python
/*
#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by: Aadithyan R
#RegisterNumber: 22000618
A=int(input())
B=int(input())
c=A**B
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",c)
*/
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
